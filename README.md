# Machine-Learning-Supervised-Learning-poly-non-linear-Regression
ðŸ“Œ Polynomial (Non-Linear) Regression
This part of the project demonstrates the implementation of Polynomial Regression, a non-linear regression technique, using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to model complex relationships between features and the target variable that cannot be captured by simple linear models.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used:
Python, Jupyter Notebook

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (PolynomialFeatures, LinearRegression)

ðŸ§ª Key Steps:
Loaded and explored the dataset

Preprocessed data (missing values, feature selection)

Transformed features using PolynomialFeatures

Trained a LinearRegression model on the transformed data

Evaluated model using Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score

Visualized actual vs predicted values for comparison
